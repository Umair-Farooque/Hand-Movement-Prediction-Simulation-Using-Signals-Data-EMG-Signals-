# Hand-Movement-Prediction-using-Nina-Pro-dataset
This project is about training a model which predicts hand movements on basis of EMG signals.

# Dataset
We have used dataset of Nina Pro for movements prediction. You can find all the information about the dataset from this website
<https://ninapro.hevs.ch/> <br>
Dataset includes 52 output labels i.e there are total 52 hand movemnts. But in this project we are only predicting 24.
These are the labels along with their corresponding Movement.<br>
